# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

catalog topic:

My website will be a jewelery shop where the catalog will be all the jewelery that is being sold.


### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

site audience:

Armenian diaspora women who love fashion and jewelery

why is this a _cohesive_ audience?

This is a cohesive audience because every member of this audience has the same goal visiting a website, which is to find a piece of jewelery in their fashion taste that they can buy. College-age implies two things: they have the same taste that is appropriate for most of the college-aged women, and they have approximately the same range for budget. College-age women who love fashion and jewelery are looking for affordable and trendy jewelery while visiting jewelery websites, and this website offeres exactly that.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Bay jewelery for themselves

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will make surfing through all the data easy and enjoyable. I will identify common categories that my audience divids into and will make sure that I include those categories to ensure that it is easy for my audience to surf the website.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By categorizing the types of jewelery I will make it easier for the audience to find what they love. As we learned in this class, users spend approxinately 10 seconds before they decide to leave the website if they haven't found what they were looking for. Hence, the user should be able to find something that they like easily. And therefore, I will be creating all the suggestions and filters to make the serach process easier.

Goal 2: Buy a gift for someone else

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will include descriptions to the pieces to help the users in their gift searching process. Additionally, I will have additional features for users who identify that they are buying the jewelery as a gift. The features might be additional free gift wraping or additing notes to the jewelery.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Many users when they are buyig gifts want to make the gift special by wraping it in a special box or adding personal notes. Hence, by adding those features to the website, it will make the user experience easier and more enjoyable. Additionally, the website will support gift searching by having descriptions and offerings (such as the most popular items or items on sale) to help the audience meet their goal.

Goal 3: Recconect with their culture and country

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - I will link all the jewelery pieces (which are originally Armenian designs and are created by Armenian designers) to historical and cultural significance to show the apparent connection to the audience's goal of reconnection to their culture. I will utilize tags and descriptions to show the categorization between different types of jewelery and their significance.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - By showing the connection between the jewelery and culture/history I will highlight the sentiment behind the piece and make a connection between the customer and the content. I will help the audience to fulfill their goal by explicitly adding fields and explanations/descriptions of what they are looking for and expect to find in the website.


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

audience device:

laptom/computer -- wide screen

audience device justification:

Users (including me) prefer to use wide screens to do shopping because wide screens make it easier to see the products bigger and open the product images bigger, which also allows to identify the details and specificts about the product. Additionally, wide screens also allow to see the descriptions and details of the products better as they are not divided and limited by the small sizes of narrow screen. Wide screens also allow to see different products, for example other product offerings and suggestions, on the same screen which is useful to explore and do comparisons. Lastly, paying. adding new information, and inserting new entries is much more convinient on the wide screen because the insert fields are bigger and you can see the whole form on the same screen.


### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

- Everything from Armenian history to modern cultural references excite her amd interest her.

**Obstacles:**

summary of persona's obstacles (1-2 bullet points):

- Ashkhen knows very little Armenian hence the language of the website has to be primarily in English or needs to be translated.
- The prices have to offordable for her because she has a limited budget as a university student.

### _Administrator_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _administrator_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

site audience:

Armenian jewelery makers

why is this a _cohesive_ audience?

All the Armenian jewelery makers the same type of jewelery which is representative of Armenian history and culture. Their goal is to sell their jewelery and hence this website is a perfect platform for them to display their products.


### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Make revenue by selling their jewelery

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will allow entry insert for independent jewelery makers and jewelery making organizations for them to enter their data into the catalog and make profit off of the sales.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By including different categories, styles, and organizations I will enlarge the audience reach and both increase the possibility for the customers' to find something according to their fashion taste and allow the jewelery makers to showcase their designs.

Goal 2: Showcase their unique brend

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will create a separate category for every jewelery maker to highlight and showcase their unique brand. Every jewevelry piece from each jeweler will have its brand's unique tags and descriptions.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This will allow not blending every jewelery maker with the rest of the jewelers but rather highlight their uniqueness. By creating separate categories and tags this would also allow the jewelers to be known by features unique to them (creating the brand image) and allow them to be searched by customers according to their unique features/tags/categories.

Goal 3: Break into the international market

- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - I will use English as the site's language to communicate to the diaspora Armenians and I will make sure that in the website it is explicit that it has delivery outside of Armenia, in different countries, primarily in the US.

- **Rationale & Additional Notes**
  - Because all the jewelers are from Armenia their customers are usually Armenians in Armenia. One of their goals is to break into a broader/bigger market of customers so that they could make more revenue. Hence, this is a perfect website for jewelers as this website's target audience is diaspora Armenians who by definition are outside Armenia.

The home page shows some parts of some of the collections and allows Ashkhen to choose to see more if she desires. This is to show what the website has to offer and show some of the variety that the collections represent. The home page of the website will also include information about Armenia and some of the symbols of Armenia for Ashkhen to later recognize those hostiry and culture sumbols in the pieces. The home page also has a navigation bar from where Ashkhen can choose to go either to the page where all the collections and products and showcased, or to navigate to the login page, to her account, her wishlist, or the cart page.

### Catalog Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Explain how you used design patterns in your site's design. (1-2 sentences)

design pattern explanation:

I have used blocks for each product to showcase the image of the product and its essential information, such as its name and the price.
